# This requirements.txt file contains the list of packages included in the Python 3.9 runtime.
#
# These packages are guaranteed to be included. Ensure that your action code only uses the listed ones.
# Other Python packages might be part of the runtime, but only due to indirect dependencies of
# the listed packages. These indirectly included packages are candidates to be removed
# at any time in case they are not required by the referring package anymore.
